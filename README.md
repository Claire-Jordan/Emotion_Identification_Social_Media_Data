# Emotion_Identification_Social_Media_Data  

Repository containing materials and code from my master’s thesis *“Emotion Identification in Social Media Data: Comparing Human and Machine Learning Model Performance.”*  
This project investigates how human annotators and machine learning models (including LLMs) perform on emotion identification tasks in social media texts.

## Repository Structure  

- **Experiment1/**  
  Contains scripts, and results from the first experiment comparing LEIA and human annotators.  

- **Experiment2/**  
  Contains scripts, and results from the second experiment investigating model-assisted annotation.  

- **Synthetic/**  
  Materials related to synthetic dataset generation using LLMs, including analyses of data quality and similarity.  

- **images/**  
  Figures and visualizations included in the thesis (plots, heatmaps, confusion matrices, etc.).  

- **cleaned_preprocessing.ipynb**
